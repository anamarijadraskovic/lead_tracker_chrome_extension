# 📌 Track Anything – Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension built as part of the **Scrimba Frontend Developer Path**.

## 🚀 Features
- Save and delete items  
- Data persistence with **localStorage**  
- Lightweight and easy to use  

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Event listeners (`click`, `dblclick`)  
- DOM manipulation (`innerHTML`, `input.value`)  
- Template strings & parameters vs. arguments  
- JSON (`stringify`, `parse`)  
- `manifest.json` configuration  
- Objects in arrays

2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome  
3. Enable **Developer Mode**
